My Jupyter notebooks and report for personal project 1 on Multilayer Perceptron Network for CX4042 Neural Network and Deep Learning course in NTU.

The assignment consists of part A and part B which deals with building MLPs for classification and regression problems respectively. Students are also supposed to carry out fine-tuning experiments on various hyperparameters and record them.

NOTE: Grade will be heavily penalised for using other DL frameworks other than Tensorflow. Also, play very close attention to how you present your report (it is a fact that the assignment is easy and the tutors will find all way (even dumbs) to deduct your marks (too small fonts, pictures not centred, etc)).
